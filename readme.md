### Container Security Scan (DOCKER-0003)
- **Analyzes Running Containers**: Checks for root user execution and read-only filesystem usage.
- **Health Checks**: Verifies configured health checks in containers.

### Image Vulnerability Scan (DOCKER-0004)
- **Utilizes Trivy**: Scans container images for vulnerabilities.
- **Focuses on High and Critical Vulnerabilities**: Identifies critical security issues.

### Daemon Security Audit (DOCKER-0005)
- **Checks Various Daemon Settings**: Includes user namespace remapping, socket permissions, and experimental features.

### Docker Compose Check (DOCKER-0006)
- **Verifies Docker Compose Version**: Recommends upgrades if necessary.

### Network Configuration Check (DOCKER-0007)
- **Identifies Use of Host Network and MacVLAN Driver**: Warns about potential security risks.
